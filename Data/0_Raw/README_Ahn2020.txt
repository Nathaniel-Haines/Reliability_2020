For Ahn (2020) data, subjects ADD106-ADD166 were collected with an error where the staircase implementation of the DDT during the first visit was incorrect (ADO results were saved in place of staircase results). Therefore, subjects were asked to come back for a third session, and folders were renamed such that S1 = S2 and S2 = S3 (e.g., ADD106_S1 was deleted, ADD106_S2 was renamed to ADD106_S1, and ADD106_S3 was renamed to ADD106_S2).
