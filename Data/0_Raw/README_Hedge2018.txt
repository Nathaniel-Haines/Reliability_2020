%%%%%%Edit 26/6/2018%%%%%%
We encourage anyone analysing the data to use exclusion criteria that they feel are appropriate or are typical in their lab. For example, we used an accuracy cut-off of 60% correct, which we appreciate is lower than other researchers might use (we chose our cut-offs because we did not want to restrict the range of performance a priori).

Using more conservative cut-offs does not change the conclusions of the paper, but may be appropriate for some purposes.

%%%%%%Notes on summary data files%%%%%%

Summary data are given in separate files for each study

The following Participant IDs are not included, as they did not return for the second session:
Study 1: 6, 17, 37
Study 2:  28, 56
Study 3: 3, 11


The data files include data from participants that were excluded in the analyses reported in the paper (see paper for exclusion criteria). These were:

Study 1: Stop-signal task only: 26,38
Study 2: All tasks: 25, 34, 38
	 Stroop only: 54
	 Stop-signal task only:3, 18 32
